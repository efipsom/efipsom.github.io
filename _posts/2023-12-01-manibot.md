ðŸ“¢ The Horizon Europe [MANiBOT project](https://manibot-project.eu/) has now started!

MANiBOT aims to empower bi-manual, mobile, service robots with superior physical capabilities; able to perform a wide variety of manipulation tasks, with highly diverse objects, in a human-like manner and performance, in diverse, challenging environments.

The project seeks to revolutionise the robotics landscape by enhancing robot's handling skills, including simple grasping, pick-and-place operations, bi-manual and non-prehensile manipulation, and ensuring adaptive responses to changing environments or to the properties of objects.

To achieve these capabilities, innovations will be developed in the fields of advanced environment understanding, efficient manipulation techniques, robot cognitive functions and physical intelligence. The researchers will implement their solutions with a focus on baggage handling and supermarket shelvesâ€™ restocking, with piloting of robots in relevant environments.
