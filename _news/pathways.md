The [UK/EU postdoc slack group](https://pdocslack.wordpress.com/) and UKRI ECR Forum are hosting a live webinar on the 15th Dec for those interested in pursuing an academic career. Our “pathways to independence” workshop will feature PIs who’ve utilised different routes towards independence and a range of funders who will discuss their schemes for ECRs.

A recording of the workshop will be available on the UK/EU pdoc slack drive space (join the slack group [here](https://join.slack.com/t/ukeupostdocs/shared_invite/zt-o3ppash3-jCy33bGe47Wa82gVlptEMg)) for those who can’t attend live. This is also the space where you can pre-ask questions for the Q&A sessions.
