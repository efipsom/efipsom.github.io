Research work within the context of the Leverhulme Trust award on ”A biomimetic forebrain for robot touch” led by [Prof. Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/).

Integration of deep learning for tactile sensing with robotic hand control for fine grasping and in-hand object manipulation.

Deep learning using convolutional neural networks on images from an optical tactile sensor (the TacTip, developed in Bristol Robotics Laboratory).
 
Non model-based torque controller using passivity theory for stability analysis. Implementation done on a three-fingered robotic hand (the Shadow Modular Grasper).
