Work done in the area of stable robotic grasping.
* Non model-based torque controller using passivity theory for stability analysis.
* Deep learning using convolutional neural networks on images from an optical tactile sensor (the TacTip, developed in Bristol Robotics Laboratory).
* Implementation on two different fully actuated robotic hands.
