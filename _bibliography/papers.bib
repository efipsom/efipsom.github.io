abstract = {This letter introduces the BRL/Pisa/IIT (BPI) SoftHand: a single actuator-driven, low-cost, 3D-printed, tendon-driven, underactuated robot hand that can be used to perform a range of grasping tasks. Based on the adaptive synergies of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, we design a new joint system and tendon routing to facilitate the inclusion of both soft and adaptive synergies, which helps us balance durability, affordability and grasping performance of the hand. The focus of this work is on the design, simulation, synergies and grasping tests of this SoftHand. The novel phalanges are designed and printed based on linkages, gear pairs and geometric restraint mechanisms, and can be applied to most tendon-driven robotic hands. We show that the robot hand can successfully grasp and lift various target objects and adapt to hold complex geometric shapes, reflecting the successful adoption of the soft and adaptive synergies. We intend to open-source the design of the hand so that it can be built cheaply on a home 3D-printer.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a controller for stable grasping of unknown-shaped objects by two robotic fingers with tactile fingertips. The grasp is stabilised by rolling the fingertips on the contact surface and applying a desired grasping force to reach an equilibrium state. The validation is both in simulation and on a fully-actuated robot hand (the Shadow Modular Grasper) fitted with custom-built optical tactile sensors (based on the BRL TacTip). The controller requires the orientations of the contact surfaces, which are estimated by regressing a deep convolutional neural network over the tactile images. Overall, the grasp system is demonstrated to achieve stable equilibrium poses on a range of objects varying in shape and softness, with the system being robust to perturbations and measurement errors. This approach also has promise to extend beyond grasping to stable in-hand object manipulation with multiple fingers.},

abstract = {Robot Assisted Surgery is attracting increasing amount of attention as it offers numerous benefits to patients as well as surgeons. Heart surgery requires a high level of precision and dexterity, in con- trast to other surgical specialties. Robot assisted heart surgery is not as widely performed due to numerous reasons including a lack of appropri- ate and intuitive surgical interfaces to control minimally invasive surgi- cal tools. In this paper, finger motion of the surgeon is analyzed during cardiac surgery tasks on an ex-vivo animal model with the purpose of designing a more intuitive master console. First, a custom finger tracking system is developed using IMU sensors, which is lightweight and com- fortable enough to allow free movement of the surgeon's fingers/hands while using instruments. The proposed system tracks finger joint angles and fingertip positions for three involved fingers (thumb, index, mid- dle). Accuracy of the IMU sensors has been evaluated using an optical tracking system (Polaris, NDI). Finger motion of the cardiac surgeon while using a Castroviejo instrument is studied in suturing and knot- ting scenarios. The results show that PIP and MCP joints have larger Range Of Motion (ROM), and faster rate of change compared to other finger/thumb joints, while thumb has the largest Fingertip WorkSpace (FWS) of all three digits.},

abstract = {A handover strategy is proposed that aims at natural and fluent robot to human object handovers. For the approaching phase, a globally asymptotically stable dynamical system (DS) is utilized, trained from human demonstrations and exploiting the existence of mirroring in the human wrist motion. The DS operates in the robot task space thus achieving independence with respect to the robot platform, encapsulating the position and orientation of the human wrist within a single DS. It is proven that the motion generated by such a DS, having as target the current wrist pose of the receiver's hand, is bounded and converges to the previously unknown handover location. Haptic cues based on load estimates at the robot giver ensure full object load transfer before grip release. The proposed strategy is validated with simulations and experiments in real settings.},

abstract = {The thesis deals with the problem of grasping by robotic hands as well as the human-robot haptic interaction during object load transfer. A passivity-based stable grasping control law for unknown object weight is exploited and extended in order to be used in the design of two strategies for the safe and natural human-robot object load transfer which takes place in the direction of the gravity field. The controller is extended with respect to the desired grasping force and the object's mass that is allocated to the respective hand. The extension is based on human studies on the grasping and load forces that are developed by the giver and receiver. The first object load transfer strategy is initiated by the giver who linearly decreases its load and grip forces until the full release of the object’s load. It is assumed that the receiver estimates the load transfer successfully and adapts its grip forces accordingly to achieve an efficient object transfer, ie. the receiver is either a cooperative and healthy human or a robot. In case the receiver is not a fully responsive participant and does not or cannot instantly accept the released load, the force exchange is not linear and as a result the object slips from the grasp since the receiver's behaviour is not taken into account. The second strategy is receiver initiated and it involves a rich haptic interaction between the hands. In this strategy, the giver is a stably grasping robotic hand that follows closely the receiver’s lead and ensures haptically that the receiver has stably grasped the object before opening its grip. Therefore, the receiver can be anyone from a fully cooperative robot to an insufficiently responsive human. Theoretical design and validation via simulations are presented for both strategies, demonstrating the advantages of the receiver initiated strategy. This strategy is generalized for cases where the robot's fingers do not possess rolling capabilities on the object's surface and for cases where the load transfer does not take place in the direction of the gravity field. The strategy is also integrated with an arm motion controller to complete the hand-over procedure and is validated by both simulations and experimental results. Consequently, the control law used in the object load transfer strategies is extended for a weightless object in order to achieve control objectives regarding the optimal grasping force which may vary for different kinds of objects or the robot's subsequent desired task following the stable object grasp. This is achieved by controlling the fingers' desired relative orientation in the rolling direction by the a priori optimization of the internal force manipulability ellipsoid. Theoretical design and validation via both simulations and experimental results are presented for the proposed controller, demonstrating its effectiveness. Last, the grasping controller is extended to the three dimensional space where the fingers' desired relative orientation is controlled with respect to two rolling directions on the contact surface. The definition of these directions determines the in-hand object manipulability. Simulation results are presented that validate the theoretical analysis.},
