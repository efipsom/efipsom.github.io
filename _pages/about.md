### Research areas

EFI-Robotics aims to create dexterous and safe robotic physical interactions with the environment or humans in unstructured scenarios by combining control methods and machine learning techniques.
* Stable object grasping and in-hand manipulation.
* Human-inspired human-robot object handover strategies.
* Control of flexible joint robots with variable elasticity.
* Non model-based control of robotic systems with prescribed performance guarantees.
* Bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback.
