I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Dept of Engineering Maths at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/efi-psomopoulou) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/tactile-robotics).

> :loudspeaker: Currently looking for PhD students. More info: [PhD post](/news/phd_position).

### Previously

* Senior Research Associate in Robotics at the Dept of Enginnering Maths at the University of Bristol.
* Teaching Fellow in Data Science at the Dept of Enginnering Maths at the University of Bristol.
* Research Associate in Medical Robotics at the Dept of Engineering, Design and Mathematics at the University of the West of England and Bristol Robotics Laboratory.
* Research Assistant at the Information Technologies Institute of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas.
* Teaching Assistant at the Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH).

I hold a Diploma (BEng/MEng) and a PhD from the Dept of ECE at AUTH.

### Research areas I work in

* Stable object grasping and in-hand manipulation.
* Human-inspired human-robot object handover strategies.
* Control of flexible joint robots with variable elasticity.
* Non model-based control of robotic systems with prescribed performance guarantees.
* Bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback for minimally invasive robotic surgery.

### Other activities and interests

* I am a Research Staff Representative in the School of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Engineering Mathematics at the Faculty of Engineering of Bristol University.
* I play the violin in the [Bristol University Symphony Orchestra](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/music/performance/calling-all-musicians/instrumental/#symphony) and in the [Bristol Symphony Orchestra](https://www.bristolsymphonyorchestra.com/).
