I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Dept of Engineering Maths at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/efi-psomopoulou) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/tactile-robotics). I am a member of the Dexterous Robotics Lab and the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/intelligent-systems/).

> :loudspeaker: Currently looking for PhD students. More info: [PhD post](/news/phd_position).

### Research areas

My research vision is to create dexterous and safe robotic physical interactions with the environment or humans in unstructured scenarios by combining control methods and machine learning techniques.
* Stable object grasping and in-hand manipulation.
* Human-inspired human-robot object handover strategies.
* Control of flexible joint robots with variable elasticity.
* Non model-based control of robotic systems with prescribed performance guarantees.
* Bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback for minimally invasive robotic surgery.

### Other roles

* I have been elected as a member of the [UK-RAS Early Career Forum](https://www.ukras.org.uk/about/early-career-forum/).
* I am a committee member of the [IEEE RAS Women In Engineering](https://www.ieee-ras.org/about-ras/governance/member-activities-board/women-in-engineering-committee).
* I play the violin in the [Bristol Symphony Orchestra](https://www.bristolsymphonyorchestra.com/).
